# lib-jitsi-meet

## Purpose
We use *lib-jitsi-meet* as the core technology for our media capturing component. The Jitsi Meet APIs have been used to create Jitsi Meet video conferences 
with a custom GUI.

We intend to build a media capturing component which connects to a vidoebridge as an hidden user to aquire media tracks (video and audio) and distribute the media 
frames via a message bus to various subscribers.
