 * Stores a configuration object for different graph types.

 * The following properties are possible, but not present in all configs:
 *
 *  title                - The title of the chart
 *  info                 - The text displayed by the info button of the chart card containing the chart
 *  empty                - The text displayed in place of a chart when there is no data to create a chart
 *  eventsFilter         - returns a function which takes an array of events and a user id. The function
 *                         returns a filtered array of events for the graph
 *  getSourceParticipant - returns the participant that initiated an event
 *  getTargetParticipant - returns the participant that the event happened to
 *  getEventTime         - returns the time that an event took place at
 *                         ex. if an utterance is deemed an influence event, then the end time of
 *                         the utterance is the time of the influence event
 *  getTooltip           - returns a generic tooltip for the graph type
 *  getTimelineTooltip   - returns a tooltip for the graph type when it's embedded in the timeline
 *  whatIsCounted        - for each graph type, what action or event are we keeping track of
 *  legendLabel          - returns a legend label for a graph type
 *  color                - returns a color for graph parts and labels for a graph type
